The datasets include all results of spherical $t$-design, the main characters are illustrated as follows
#
t is the degree of spherical polynomials;
#
N is the number of points, N=(t+1)^2;
#
X0 is the initial points set, we use extremal points, you can find in https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~rsw/Sphere/;
#
XX is the terminal points set, which is the result of BB method or QN method in computing spherical $t$-design;
#
minY is the minimal singular value, which is used to verify XX is a spherical $t$-design.
